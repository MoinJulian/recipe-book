<h2>Liability for content</h2>
<p>
  As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages
  according to Section 7, Paragraph 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG).
  According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider are not obliged
  to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
  circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
</p>

<p>
  Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general
  laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible
  from the point in time at which knowledge of a specific infringement of the
  law is known. As soon as we become aware of any violations of the law, we will
  remove this content immediately.
</p>

<h2>Liability for links</h2>

<p>
  Our offer contains links to external websites over which we have no influence.
  Therefore we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The
  respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the
  content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
  violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the
  time of linking.
</p>

<p>
  However, a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not
  reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. As soon as we become
  aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
</p>

<h2>Copyright</h2>

  to German copyright law. The duplication, editing, distribution and any kind
  of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of
  the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only
  permitted for private, non-commercial use.
</p>

<p>
  Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the
  copyrights of third parties are observed. In particular contents of third
  parties are marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a
  copyright infringement, we ask that you inform us accordingly. As soon as we
  become aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.
